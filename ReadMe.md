# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## 1. Overview
- **Monolithic Architecture**: A single unified application where all components are tightly integrated.
- **Microservices Architecture**: A distributed system where the application is broken down into smaller, independently deployable services.

---

## 2. Key Differences

| Feature             | Monolithic Architecture | Microservices Architecture |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Structure**      | Single codebase(BE+FE+Auth+Email...etc)| Multiple independent services(Diff FE + Diff BE + Diff etc..)|
| **Code Repo**      |Single Code Repo | Multiple Codes Repos for Multiple services|
| **Scalability**    | Scales as a whole  | Individual services can be scaled separately |
| **Deployment**     | Entire application redeployed on change | Each service can be deployed independently |
| **Technology Stack** | Usually a single technology stack | Different services can use different technologies |
| **Development Speed** | Slower as the codebase grows | Faster due to independent services |
| **Fault Isolation** | A failure can crash the entire system | Failure in one service does not affect others |
| **Data Storage**   | Single database shared by all components | Each microservice can have its own database |
| **Maintenance**    | Becomes difficult over time | Easier due to smaller, manageable services |
| **Communication**  | Internal function calls | API-based communication (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) |
| **Best for**       | Small to medium applications | Large-scale, complex applications |

---

## 3. Advantages and Disadvantages

### ‚úÖ **Monolithic Architecture Advantages**:
- Simple to develop and deploy.
- Easier debugging and testing.
- Less infrastructure overhead.

### ‚ùå **Monolithic Architecture Disadvantages**:
- Harder to scale as the application grows.
- A single failure can bring down the entire system.
- Difficult to adopt new technologies.

### ‚úÖ **Microservices Architecture Advantages**:
- Better scalability and flexibility.
- Independent deployment of services.
- Easier fault isolation and resilience.

### ‚ùå **Microservices Architecture Disadvantages**:
- Complex service communication and orchestration.
- Higher infrastructure and operational overhead.
- Requires skilled teams for efficient management.

---

## 4. When to Use What?
- **Use Monolithic Architecture** if:
  - The application is small or medium-sized.
  - You need quick development and simple deployment.
  - You don‚Äôt have expertise in distributed systems.

- **Use Microservices Architecture** if:
  - The application is large and complex.
  - Scalability and flexibility are priorities.
  - You have a skilled development team to manage distributed services.

---
## 5. Conclusion
Both architectures have their place. Monolithic is good for simpler applications, while Microservices is better for complex, scalable systems. The choice depends on project requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintainability.


# Different Types of HTTP Methods
_GET_: To Get the Data from the Resource(DataBase).
_POST_: To Send the Data to the Resource(DataBase).
_PUT_: To Update the whole Resource.
_PATCH_: To Update the Some Parts of the Resource.
_DELETE_:To Delete the Data at Resource(DataBase).


# Initialize Our Project from Scratch:
To initialize our project that is to give a name for our project and other configurations we run __npm init__ then we enter the name of the project and other configurations as required. 
So it takes all the provided configurations about project and creates a __package.json__ file which is like a index of our project(which tells more info about the project) and contains all the information from project name to Project Configurations,Packages used in the project etc.

And that's how we initialize a node Project.


So Next we created a src folder which is the main folder containing __app.js__ file and we can start writing the code inside it.

We will be Using Express JS for creating our Server in this Project.

# Difference Between Node.js and Express.js

| Feature        | Node.js  | Express.js  |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server. | A web framework built on top of Node.js to simplify web app and API development. |
| **Purpose** | Provides the core functionality for server-side JavaScript execution. | Helps in building web applications, APIs, and handling HTTP requests easily. |
| **Level** | Low-level (provides modules like HTTP, FS, Path, etc.). | High-level (built on top of Node.js for web development). |
| **Functionality** | Handles file system operations, networking, streams, etc. | Simplifies request handling, routing, and middleware management. |
| **Routing** | Requires manual routing using core `http` module. | Provides a built-in routing system with easy-to-use methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc. |
| **Middleware** | No built-in middleware support; must be implemented manually. | Supports middleware functions to handle requests, responses, and errors easily. |
| **Flexibility** | Provides more control over server creation and request handling. | Abstracts complexities, making development faster and easier. |
| **Use Case** | Used for building real-time applications, networking apps, and backend services. | Ideal for building web applications, RESTful APIs, and server-side applications. |

## Summary
- **Node.js** is the **core runtime** for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js** is a **framework** that makes web and API development easier using Node.js.


when we ran __npm i express__ it generated 2 files __package-lock.json__ and __node_modules__ along with package.json that was already there.
So after running the command _npm i express_ all the source code of express that is required to run create and run our app using express JS was 
downloaded and is put inside the node_modules folder.
The express also comes with the some other dependencies so those dependencies are also downloaded and put into node_modules folder.So like 
this all the dependencies that are required in our project are downloaded and put inside node_modules folder.

And then our _package.json_ was also updated and express was added as a dependency inside __package.json__ file.
A dependency simply means that any package that our project is dependent on and our project cannot run with It.

"express": "^4.21.2"

When we install __express__ or any Package in our project it gets installed with any version like (_4.21.2_) 

And Similarly when we install any dependency the first digit in version (4) means major update verison which is not backward compatible and it can break our app if we install the major verison in our app which is running on minor version for eg: we are using version 4.x.x in our app and we install 5.x.x version so it represents some major update in our app and it could break our application

The second digits (21) represents minor updates(Changes) which can be installed in our app and wil not do any harm The third digits (2) represents patch updates(just some Bug fix) which are also safe to install in our app and will not do any harm.

__(^)__ symbol means our app can accept minor and patch updates without any issues,That means our project will automatically be updated if any of the new version comes in with __4.X.X__ series. __(~)__ symbol means our app avoids Minor or Major updates and only accepts Patch updates with-in same minor Version. If it does not have any symbol then it means that project needs exact version of dependencies to run and it will never Auto-Update that is will not accept any Major or Minor Update.

- ^ (Caret) symbol: Allows minor and patch updates within the same major version.
      Example: "express": "^4.17.1" ‚Üí Accepts 4.18.0, 4.19.0, etc., but not 5.0.0.
- ~ (Tilde) symbol: Allows only patch updates within the same minor version.
      Example: "express": "~4.17.1" ‚Üí Accepts 4.17.2, 4.17.3, etc., but not 4.18.0.
-   No Symbol (Exact Version): Locks the dependency to an exact version, meaning no automatic updates.
      Example: "express": "4.17.1" ‚Üí Only installs 4.17.1, and never updates automatically.


while pacakage.json is flexible with installing new minor updates or patch versions but pacakage.lock.json will install exact version of the dependency and will not accept any changes in its version minor or major.
For eg: Our Package.json might have any version of the dependency (4.21.2) but packaage-lock.json will have exact version of the dependency
that our project is running on.

## Creating Our Server:
Now after installing _express_ in our machine we will create our server using express.
__"const express = require("express")"__

So here we have required the _express_ and it is coming from our _node_modules_ folder in which it is installed.
And next we will create an instance of our express Js Application by doing.

const app = express()


Creating an instance of express means that we are assigning the instance of express in that particular variable and we no longer need to right express everytime instead we can get all the properties or methods from the app.
This app object inherits all the properties and methods of Express.
Now, instead of calling express.methodName(), We can simply use app.methodName()

Now we can call __listen__ method on our app instance and our server will listen on that patricular port 
which we have specified in our listen method.

```javascript
app.listen(3000)
```

Once we make our app listen on port __3000__ using app.listen(3000) we can also pass a callback function iniside it, 
and the callback function will be only called once our server is listening on that particular port.
```javascript
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
app.listen(3000,()=>{
  console.log("Server is listening on Port 3000:")
})
```

So Here our Server is listening on Port 3000 but it is not handling any incoming Requests.
So need to tell our server how to handle incoming requests.
```javascript
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello I am responding üòÅ");
});
```

Using the above request handler we have Responded to all the incoming request on our port 3000.
But We should not __app.use__ on our request handler as it will match all the incoming requests(Get,Put,Post,Delete)
for eg: Instead of using app.use we should use app.get or app.post etc. http methods as __app.use__ matches all the 4 http methods 
coming to it.

app.use() is mainly used for middleware functions, which execute before your route handlers. These middlewares can:

‚úÖ Run on every request (like logging or authentication)
‚úÖ Modify request/response objects (e.g., parse JSON, add headers)
‚úÖ Serve static files
‚úÖ Handle errors or 404 pages

we can also pass a route parameter before our req,res parameters so that our server will only respond to the requests coming to that route.
```javascript
app.use("/hello",(req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello I am responding üòÅ");
}); 
``` 

In Express.js, methods like .use(), .get(), .post(), .put(), .delete(), etc., take two parameters:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Path (string) ‚Üí The URL endpoint where the request is handled.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Request Handler (function) ‚Üí The callback function that processes the request (req, res, next).

Similarly we can add any other Route in our Applicatin and it will also respond to the requests on that Route.
```javascript
app.use("/test", (req, res) => {
  res.send("This is The test Route");
});
```
As everytime we make any changes in our file we have to stop our server(ctr+c) and restart it to reflect those changes on our browser.
To solve this issue we can install nodemon(It is a utility file which monitors our app for any changes and automatically restart it.)
using _npm install -g nodemon_ and then restart our server using command _nodemon filename.js_ instead of _npm src/app.js_.
And nodemon will watch our app for any changes and will start it automatically when anything changes.

When we install a Package globally it gets installed at _C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules_

Instead of writing _nodemon src/app.js_ everytime we want to start our server using Nodemon we can specify a script like below in our 
our package.json  
```javascript
"start":"node src/app.js",
    "dev":"nodemon src/app.js"
```
And then when we want to start our server in watch mode for any changes then we can start it using the script __npm run dev__
and it will actually use the above above command to start our app using _Nodemon_.
Or We can also Run our app using _npm run Start_ and then it will start our app in normal mode behind the scenes like above in which we have 
to manually start our after any changes.
